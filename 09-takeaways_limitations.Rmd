# Project Takeaways and Limitations

As I move forward with testing and refining this pitch location metric, my primary objectives include assessing its reliability and exploring various applications. One key avenue for exploration involves tracking how a pitcher's quality of location evolves over time. This longitudinal analysis could uncover patterns in a pitcher's performance, shedding light on the consistency or fluctuations in their pitch location effectiveness.

Additionally, I plan to conduct comparative analyses to evaluate the correlation between the proposed metric and overall pitcher performance as reflected in game results. Understanding the strength of this correlation will be crucial in determining the metric's predictive power and its ability to capture nuances that contribute to a pitcher's success or challenges on the mound.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the current limitations of the project metric. One notable concern is the uniform evaluation of pitches within distinct pitch type classes, regardless of other critical characteristics. For instance, comparing two 4-Seam Fastballs solely based on location overlooks essential factors such as velocity, spin rate, movement, and release point. An 89 MPH fastball placed at the top of the strike zone differs significantly from a 99 MPH fastball in the same location. Recognizing these nuances is crucial, and while I intentionally omitted certain factors for simplicity, future iterations may explore ways to incorporate additional dimensions of pitch quality.

The variability in the number of observations across the 288 data frames highlights another challenge. Some combinations of handedness, pitch type, and count result in well-defined plots with distinct regions of good and bad location quality, while others appear more ambiguous. Addressing this variability will involve refining the metric to ensure robust evaluations across all unique situations.

The treatment of pitch types, such as Splitters and Changeups, requires further consideration. While these pitches share similarities in velocity and movement, they possess distinct characteristics that merit separate evaluations. Future iterations may involve refining the classification of certain pitch types to enhance the metric's precision.

The exclusion of outlier pitches, while done for simplicity, has implications for the comprehensiveness of the metric. Pitches falling outside the 99% range established by a particular pitch type are currently disregarded. Recognizing the potential impact of outlier pitches, I plan to explore methodologies that appropriately incorporate extreme cases into the analysis.

In summary, this project aims to bring fresh perspectives to pitcher evaluations in 2023 by emphasizing the significance of pitch location, a facet that might be underappreciated in the current baseball analytics landscape dominated by Statcast data. As this new location metric evolves, the goal is to provide a more comprehensive understanding of pitcher performance, incorporating factors beyond the conventional metrics. I look forward to refining and expanding this approach to contribute valuable insights to the field of baseball analytics.
