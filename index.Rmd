# Introduction

## Project Overview

In recent years, the baseball industry has undergone a transformative shift towards a more data-driven approach. Organizations now heavily rely on advanced metrics and statistical analyses for crucial decision-making processes. This evolution has provided fans with an abundance of new insights into evaluating MLB players. With technologies like Statcast generating extensive data on ball movement, enthusiasts can now gain a clearer understanding of key metrics such as release speed, spin rate, and pitch movement's horizontal and vertical components, influencing a pitcher's throw quality.

Websites like Baseball Savant and Fangraphs contribute significantly by offering comprehensive information on MLB pitchers, covering aspects such as batted ball results, the effectiveness of pitch arsenals, and detailed profiles of each pitch type, including velocity, movement, and spin rate. The wealth of available analytics related to MLB players in 2023 is unprecedented.

In my exploration of emerging baseball metrics aimed at painting a comprehensive picture of a pitcher's skill or an individual pitch's quality, I've identified an often-underrepresented aspect: pitch-level location quality. While metrics like BB% and FIP provide insights into overall pitching proficiency, I've yet to encounter a metric that assesses pitchers based on the quality of the locations they choose for their pitches.

The Baseball Savant website features player dashboards displaying distributions of a pitcher's pitches across different location zone types, including heart, shadow, chase, and waste. However, comparing pitchers based on their distribution of zone types is not straightforward. One might assume that the shadow region represents an ideal pitch location, suggesting that pitchers with a higher rate of shadow region pitches are the best at locating their pitches. However, the context matters. For instance, a pitch thrown in the shadow region on a 3-0 count might not be an ideal location if it's technically outside the strike zone.

Furthermore, pitch type plays a crucial role in evaluating location quality. A 4-seam fastball thrown at the top of the strike zone in a 2-0 count may differ significantly in location quality from a curveball thrown in the same location under similar circumstances. Recognizing these nuances is essential, indicating that evaluating pitch location quality is a complex task influenced by the specific circumstances in which the pitch is made.

The goal of this project is to create a pitch-level metric that assesses the quality of an individual pitch's location. Several factors contribute to this metric, including the horizontal distance from the plate as the ball passes (plate_x), the vertical height of the ball from the ground as it passes (plate_z), the pitch type, and the hitter count when the pitch is thrown (0-1, 2-2, 3-2, etc.).

By visualizing the output and comparing pitches under different circumstances, we aim to identify ideal pitch locations given specific situations and distinguish less-than-ideal locations. This output can then be applied to pitches thrown in previous seasons by particular players, enabling effective comparisons of players based on their proficiency in locating pitches. Questions regarding a player's proficiency in locating specific pitch types and the trajectory of their overall pitch location over time can be answered using this new location quality metric. Let's embark on this exploration.
